# Railway Vite Config Fix - Final Solution

## Problem:
The `vite.config.ts` file uses `import.meta.dirname` which is undefined in Railway's build environment, causing:
```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

## Solution Applied:
**Bypassed problematic vite.config.ts entirely** by using direct build commands in nixpacks.toml:

### Updated Build Process:
1. **Frontend Build**: `cd client && npx vite build --outDir ../dist/public`
   - Builds directly from client directory 
   - Uses relative paths that work in Railway environment
   - No dependency on vite.config.ts path resolution

2. **Backend Build**: Standard esbuild process remains the same

3. **No Config File Dependencies**: Eliminates all `import.meta.dirname` and path resolution issues

## Expected Results:
```
ðŸ”§ Using standard PostgreSQL connection for Railway
âœ… Database connected successfully  
ðŸš€ Backend server running on port 5000
```

## Files Updated:
- `nixpacks.toml` - Direct build commands without config file
- `build.sh` - Updated as backup approach with inline config

This approach completely eliminates the vite.config.ts path resolution issue by building directly from the client directory with explicit output paths that work in Railway's build environment.
