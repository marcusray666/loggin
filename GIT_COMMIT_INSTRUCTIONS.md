# üìù How to Commit the vercel.json File

## The vercel.json file is ready and contains the correct configuration!

Since Replit has git restrictions, here are your options to commit the file:

## Option 1: Use Replit's Built-in Git (Recommended)
1. **Look for the Git panel** in the left sidebar of Replit (looks like a branch icon)
2. **Click the Git panel** to open version control
3. **Stage the vercel.json file** by clicking the + next to it
4. **Add commit message**: "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
5. **Click "Commit & Push"**

## Option 2: Terminal in Replit
1. **Click "Shell" tab** at the bottom of Replit
2. **Run these commands one by one**:
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 3: GitHub Web Interface
1. **Go to your GitHub repository** (github.com/marcusray666/loggin)
2. **Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"**
3. **Upload the vercel.json file** from your computer
4. **Commit the changes**

## Option 4: Direct Edit on GitHub
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Create new file"**
3. **Name it**: `vercel.json`
4. **Copy and paste this content**:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com"
  }
}
```
5. **Commit the file**

## What Happens Next
Once committed, Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the new configuration
- Redeploy your site with frontend-only build
- lggn.net will show your actual website instead of code

Your backend is already working perfectly - this one commit completes the deployment!
