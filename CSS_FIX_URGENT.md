# ðŸš¨ URGENT CSS Fix Required

## Problem
The website is loading but CSS styling is broken - barely visible text and poor layout.

## Root Cause
The deployed CSS on Vercel doesn't match our local fixes. The theme classes aren't being applied correctly.

## IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED

You need to manually push the updated CSS to trigger Vercel redeploy:

### Method 1: Manual Git Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CSS styling issues"
git push origin main
```

### Method 2: Force Vercel Redeploy
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find the loggin project
3. Click "Redeploy" 
4. This will pull latest code and rebuild with correct CSS

## What Will Be Fixed
- âœ… Proper light theme colors
- âœ… Readable black text on white background  
- âœ… Correct navigation positioning
- âœ… Glass card styling
- âœ… Professional layout

The build just completed successfully with updated CSS files - we just need Vercel to deploy them.
