   ```

6. **Deploy**
   - Railway builds and deploys automatically
   - Get your app URL from the dashboard

### Cost: $5-20/month (usage-based)

## ü•à ALTERNATIVE: DigitalOcean App Platform

Good Heroku alternative with managed PostgreSQL:

### Benefits:
- **Predictable Pricing**: $12/month for app + $15/month for database
- **Managed Database**: PostgreSQL with automated backups
- **Docker Support**: Full control over environment
- **Built-in CDN**: Global content delivery

### DigitalOcean Deployment:
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Configure build command: `npm run build`
3. Configure run command: `npm start`
4. Add managed PostgreSQL database
5. Set environment variables

## ü•â ALTERNATIVE: Render (Current Backend Host)

Expand your current Render setup to fullstack:

### Benefits:
- **You're already using it** for backend
- **Free tier available** for frontend
- **Background workers** for blockchain jobs
- **Predictable pricing** with fixed monthly costs

### Render Fullstack Setup:
1. **Keep backend service** (currently running)
2. **Add static site service** for frontend
3. **Connect both services** with environment variables

## ‚ùå NOT RECOMMENDED: Vercel Fullstack

While possible, Vercel has limitations for your app:
- **Serverless functions only** (10-second timeout for uploads)
- **No persistent storage** (uploaded files disappear)
- **No WebSocket support** (breaks real-time features)
- **Complex pricing** at scale

## Your Current Architecture Analysis

**Problems with current split setup:**
- ‚ùå **CORS complexity** between domains
- ‚ùå **Higher costs** (two platforms)
- ‚ùå **Deployment complexity** (coordinate two deployments)
- ‚ùå **Session issues** across domains

**Benefits of unified deployment:**
- ‚úÖ **Single domain** - No CORS issues
- ‚úÖ **Shared sessions** - Better authentication
- ‚úÖ **Simpler deployment** - One command deploys everything
- ‚úÖ **Lower costs** - One platform fee
- ‚úÖ **Better performance** - No cross-domain requests

## Migration Steps

1. **Backup your data** from Render PostgreSQL
2. **Choose platform** (Railway recommended)
3. **Update configuration** for unified deployment
4. **Test thoroughly** in staging environment
5. **Migrate database** to new platform
6. **Update DNS** to point to new deployment

## Ready-to-Deploy Configuration

Your app is already configured for Railway deployment with:
- ‚úÖ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- ‚úÖ `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration  
- ‚úÖ Unified server setup (Express + Vite)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection ready
- ‚úÖ File upload handling configured

Choose Railway for the best fullstack experience!
