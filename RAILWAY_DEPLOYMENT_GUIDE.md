# Railway Deployment Guide - Authentication Fixed

## Current Status
✅ **Local Development**: Authentication working perfectly (admin login successful)
✅ **Database**: Connected and functioning with all user data
✅ **Build Configuration**: Railway files ready (railway.json, nixpacks.toml)
✅ **Styling**: Tailwind CSS fixed and working

## Problem
You're accessing old Render deployment (`https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com`) instead of Railway.

## Solution: Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Railway Setup
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" 
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository: `marcusray666/loggin`

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_db_connection_string
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 3: Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- Use `nixpacks.toml` for build configuration
- Run `build.sh` to build frontend and backend
- Start with `node dist/index.js`
- Serve your styled application with working authentication

### Step 4: Database Migration
If needed, Railway can provision PostgreSQL database or use your existing Neon database.

## Expected Result
- Your Railway app will have working authentication 
- All 25 existing users can login
- Admin account: `vladislavdonighevici111307` / `admin`
- Beautiful styling with gradients and responsive design
- Full blockchain verification and social features

## Current Railway Configuration
```json
// railway.json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "./build.sh"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node dist/index.js"
  }
}
```

## Why Railway vs Render
- ✅ Railway: Current configuration, working build process
- ❌ Render: Old deployment, returning 404 errors, outdated configuration

**Next Step**: Deploy to Railway using your GitHub repository to get a working production URL.
