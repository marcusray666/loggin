# ðŸŽ¯ Render Frontend Alternative - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Vercel is stuck on commit 262dd2d. Since your backend is already working perfectly on Render, let's deploy the frontend there too.

## Solution: Deploy Frontend to Render

### Step 1: Create New Render Service
1. Go to **render.com** (you already have an account)
2. Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Static Site"**
3. Connect your **marcusray666/loggin** repository

### Step 2: Configure Build Settings
- **Name**: `loggin-frontend`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Root Directory**: `client`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add environment variable:
- **VITE_API_URL**: `https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com`

### Step 4: Deploy
Click **"Create Static Site"** - Render will deploy from your latest commit

## Advantages
âœ… Same platform as your backend (easier management)  
âœ… Will use latest commit (not stuck like Vercel)  
âœ… Reliable deployment pipeline  
âœ… Can configure custom domain later  
âœ… Both frontend and backend on same trusted platform  

## Result
- **Frontend**: New Render URL (e.g., loggin-frontend.onrender.com)
- **Backend**: https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com (unchanged)
- **Database**: Same PostgreSQL (unchanged)
- **Full Platform**: Completely operational

This bypasses the Vercel issue entirely and gives you a working deployment!
