# ðŸ”§ Merge Conflict Resolution - Simple Fix

## What's Happening
There's a merge conflict on `vercel.json` because:
- Your local version has my Vercel fixes
- The remote version has different changes
- Git needs you to choose which version to keep

## Simple Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Use My Fixed Version (Recommended)
1. Click on **vercel.json** in the conflicting files list
2. You'll see both versions marked with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`
3. **Keep my version** which has:
   - `"buildCommand": "node vercel-build.js"`
   - `"outputDirectory": "client/dist"`
   - Frontend-only configuration
4. Delete the conflict markers and remote version
5. Click **"Complete merge and commit"**

### Option 2: Manual Fix
If the conflict editor doesn't work:
1. Click **"Abort merge"**
2. I'll recreate the vercel.json file with the correct content
3. Then commit and push normally

## What the Fix Contains
My vercel.json ensures:
- Frontend-only deployment
- Correct build commands
- Proper output directory
- API connection to your working backend
