# âœ… Vercel Code Fix Implemented

## Files Modified/Created:

### 1. vercel.json (Updated)
- Forces frontend-only build with custom build script
- Sets correct output directory (client/dist)
- Adds proper SPA routing
- Configures API URL environment variable

### 2. .vercelignore (New)
- Excludes server/ and backend/ directories
- Prevents Vercel from processing server files
- Ignores development files and logs

### 3. vercel-build.js (New)
- Custom build script that ensures frontend-only compilation
- Changes to client directory before building
- Uses npm ci for faster, reliable installs
- Provides clear build logging

## How This Fixes the Issue:

**Problem**: Vercel was using root package.json build script:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ..."
```
This compiled both frontend AND backend server code.

**Solution**: Custom build configuration that:
1. Ignores server files (.vercelignore)
2. Uses dedicated frontend build script (vercel-build.js)
3. Only builds client directory
4. Outputs to client/dist

## Expected Result:
- lggn.net will show your React frontend instead of server code
- Frontend connects to your working backend at https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com
- Full platform operational

The code fix is complete and ready for deployment!
