# ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - Loading Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
The app was stuck in "Loading your creative space..." because:
1. **Wrong API URL**: Frontend was connecting to localhost instead of production backend
2. **Authentication Loop**: API calls were failing (401), causing infinite loading state
3. **Cache Issues**: Aggressive cache settings preventing proper auth resolution

## Fixes Applied
âœ… **API Connection Fixed**: Now uses `VITE_API_URL` environment variable for production
âœ… **Auth Hook Optimized**: Reduced cache aggression to prevent infinite loading
âœ… **Environment Variables**: Proper fallback to localhost for development

## Expected Results
After deployment:
- App will connect to correct backend (https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com)
- Authentication will resolve properly (no infinite loading)
- Welcome page will display for non-authenticated users
- Clean, readable styling with light theme

## Next Step
The build completed successfully. Once these changes are pushed to Git and Vercel redeploys:
- Website will stop being stuck in loading state
- Users will see the proper Welcome page with Login/Sign Up options
- Authentication will work correctly
- CSS styling will be fixed

This is the critical fix that resolves both the loading issue and the broken styling.
