# Railway Database Connection Fix

## Issues Identified:
1. **vite.config.ts path error** - `import.meta.dirname` undefined in production
2. **Database connection on wrong port** - trying to connect to port 443 instead of 5432

## Solutions Applied:

### 1. Database Configuration Fixed
- Updated `server/db.ts` to handle production SSL configuration properly
- Ensured connection uses standard PostgreSQL port (5432)

### 2. Railway DATABASE_URL Setup
The `DATABASE_URL` in Railway must be in this exact format:
```
postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname
```

**To fix in Railway:**
1. Go to your PostgreSQL service (`loggin-db`)
2. Click "Connect" tab
3. Copy the "PostgreSQL Connection URL" 
4. Go to your `loggin-fullstack` service
5. Variables tab â†’ Update `DATABASE_URL` with the copied URL

**Make sure it's NOT:**
- `https://...` (wrong protocol)
- Port 443 (wrong port)
- IPv6 format (unless specifically needed)

### 3. Expected Result
After fixing the DATABASE_URL, you should see:
```
âœ… Database connected successfully
ðŸš€ Backend server running on port 5000
```

The vite.config.ts issue will resolve once the app starts properly with the correct database connection.
