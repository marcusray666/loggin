# ✅ IMPORT PATHS FIXED

## Issue Resolved
The deployment was failing because backend files were using `@shared/schema` imports instead of relative paths.

## Fixed Files:
- `backend/src/routes.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/storage.ts` ✅  
- `backend/src/routes/blockchain-routes.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/services/blockchain-service.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/services/ipfs-service.ts` ✅
- `backend/src/services/wallet-service.ts` ✅

## Changed From:
```typescript
import { users } from '@shared/schema';
```

## Changed To:
```typescript
import { users } from '../shared/schema.js';
import { users } from '../../shared/schema.js';
```

## Status
✅ All import paths now use relative paths compatible with the backend directory structure
✅ Ready for deployment - tsx should now resolve all modules correctly
✅ No more "Cannot find module '@shared/schema'" errors

## Next Steps
Push changes to GitHub and redeploy in Render - the backend should start successfully now.
