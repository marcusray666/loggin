# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Duplicate Class Methods in server/storage.ts
- ✅ Removed duplicate `getUserWorks` method (line 500)
- ✅ Replaced old `followUser`, `unfollowUser`, `isFollowing` methods with complete implementation using `userFollows` table
- ✅ Replaced old notification methods with `UserNotification` implementation

### 2. Railway Configuration Fixed
- ✅ Updated `railway.json` to use correct build process
- ✅ Fixed `nixpacks.toml` to handle unified architecture
- ✅ Created `build.sh` script for proper frontend + backend building
- ✅ Fixed start command syntax error

### 3. Build Process
- ✅ Build script now properly:
  - Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
  - Builds frontend with `vite build`
  - Builds backend with `esbuild`
  - Sets up production environment

## Current Status:
- Build should now complete successfully on Railway
- Duplicate method warnings eliminated
- Container start error fixed
- Ready for redeploy

## Next Steps:
1. Trigger a new deployment on Railway
2. Verify the application starts without errors
3. Test the application functionality

The build process now correctly handles our unified fullstack architecture where frontend and backend are in the same repository but built separately.
