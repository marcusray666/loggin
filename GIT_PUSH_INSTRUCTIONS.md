# ðŸ“‹ Exact Steps to Upload vercel.json to GitHub

## The vercel.json file is ready but needs to be committed to GitHub

### Step 1: Copy This Content
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "cd client && npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to **github.com/marcusray666/loggin**
2. Look for `vercel.json` file
   - If it exists: Click the file â†’ Click "Edit this file" (pencil icon)
   - If it doesn't exist: Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file" â†’ Name it `vercel.json`
3. Replace/add the content above
4. Scroll down and commit: "Fix Vercel frontend deployment configuration"

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment
Vercel will detect the new commit and automatically redeploy with the correct frontend-only configuration.

## Why Manual Upload is Required
Replit restricts git operations for security, so the changes must be uploaded through GitHub's web interface.

## Expected Result
Once committed:
- Vercel deploys from latest commit (not stuck on 262dd2d)
- Builds only frontend (client directory)
- lggn.net shows your actual Loggin' website
- Platform fully operational
