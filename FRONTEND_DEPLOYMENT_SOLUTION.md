# 🚀 Frontend Deployment Solution - Loggin' Platform

## Issue Resolved
Your lggn.net deployment is showing code because it's building from the wrong directory. Here's the exact fix:

## For Your Current Deployment (lggn.net)

### Update Build Settings:
1. **Root Directory**: `client` (not the main directory)
2. **Build Command**: `npm run build` 
3. **Build Output Directory**: `dist`
4. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com
   ```

### Alternative: Use Main Directory
If you can't change root directory:
1. **Root Directory**: `.` (main directory)
2. **Build Command**: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
3. **Build Output Directory**: `client/dist`

## File Structure Explanation
```
loggin/
├── client/               ← Frontend React app (deploy this)
│   ├── package.json     ← Frontend dependencies
│   ├── vite.config.ts   ← Frontend build config
│   └── src/             ← React components
├── server/              ← Backend API (already deployed to Render)
└── package.json         ← Full-stack config (don't use for frontend)
```

## Expected Result After Fix
✅ lggn.net shows proper Loggin' website  
✅ Login/register forms work  
✅ Connects to backend at loggin-64qr.onrender.com  
✅ Full platform functionality restored  

## Alternative: Quick Test Build
Run locally to verify:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
# Upload contents of client/dist/ folder
```

Your backend is perfect - just need the frontend to build from the right location!
