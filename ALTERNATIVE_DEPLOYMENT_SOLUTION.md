# ðŸš€ Alternative Deployment Solution - Netlify

## The Problem
Vercel is completely stuck on commit 262dd2d and refuses to deploy newer commits, despite multiple attempts and configurations.

## Solution: Deploy to Netlify Instead

### Why Netlify?
- More reliable git integration
- Better handling of monorepo frontend deployments
- Simpler configuration override system
- Your backend is already working perfectly on Render

### Step 1: Create Netlify Account
1. Go to **netlify.com**
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories

### Step 2: Deploy from GitHub
1. Click **"New site from Git"**
2. Choose **GitHub**
3. Select **marcusray666/loggin** repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `client`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `client/dist`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in Netlify:
- **VITE_API_URL**: `https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com`

### Step 4: Deploy
Click **"Deploy site"** - Netlify will build from your latest commit (not stuck on 262dd2d)

## Expected Result
âœ… Frontend deploys from latest commit  
âœ… Connects to your working backend  
âœ… Full platform operational on new domain  
âœ… Can later configure custom domain (lggn.net)  

## Why This Works
- Netlify properly detects latest commits
- Better monorepo handling than Vercel
- Your backend continues working unchanged
- Simple migration of custom domain later

Your backend is perfect - this gives you a working frontend deployment!
