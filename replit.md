# Loggin' Platform - Digital Art Protection & Social Network

## Overview

Loggin' is a comprehensive digital art protection platform that combines blockchain-powered copyright verification with social networking features. The platform enables creators to instantly protect their digital work with immutable blockchain certificates while building a community around authentic creative content.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend/Backend Separation
The application is architected for separate hosting with distinct frontend and backend applications:
- **Frontend**: React-based client application deployable to static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
- **Backend**: Express.js API server deployable to platforms like Railway or Render
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup for separate domain hosting

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js, PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum mainnet integration with Ethers.js
- **Authentication**: Session-based with secure cookies
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with blockchain anchoring

## Key Components

- **Usage tracking** for monthly upload quotas

## Data Flow

### Upload Process
1. **File validation** â†’ **Content moderation** â†’ **Hash generation** â†’ **Blockchain anchoring** â†’ **Certificate creation** â†’ **Database storage**

### Social Interactions
1. **Post creation** â†’ **Content screening** â†’ **Database storage** â†’ **Real-time updates** â†’ **Notification dispatch**

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login request** â†’ **Credential validation** â†’ **Session creation** â†’ **Role verification** â†’ **Access control**

## External Dependencies

### Blockchain Services
- **Ethereum mainnet RPC** (via eth.llamarpc.com)
- **Ethers.js library** for blockchain interactions
- **OpenTimestamps** for Bitcoin anchoring (fallback)

### Payment Processing
- **Stripe API** for subscription billing and payment processing
- **Webhook handling** for subscription lifecycle events

### Development Tools
- **Vite** for frontend build and development
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **TanStack Query** for server state management

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Architecture
- **Frontend hosting**: Static site deployment (Vercel recommended)
- **Backend hosting**: Node.js platform (Railway recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon or similar)
- **Environment separation**: Distinct configurations for frontend (VITE_*) and backend

### Security Measures
- **Helmet.js** for security headers
- **Rate limiting** for API protection
- **Trust proxy** configuration for production
- **Secure session cookies** with proper CORS policies

### Development Setup
- **Unified development** environment with proxy configuration
- **Hot module replacement** via Vite
- **Type safety** throughout with shared schema definitions
- **Local file uploads** directory for development

The platform is designed as a production-ready application with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive security measures, and scalable architecture supporting both individual creators and enterprise use cases.
