# âœ… JSON SYNTAX ERROR FIXED

## Problem Identified
The package.json had:
- **Duplicate "dependencies" sections** 
- **Missing comma between sections**
- **Malformed "devDependencies" structure**

## âœ… Fixed Issues
- Removed duplicate dependencies
- Fixed JSON structure 
- Merged all dependencies into single section
- Added proper engines specification

## ðŸš€ Ready for Deployment

Your Render configuration is now correct:
- **Root Directory:** `backend` âœ…
- **Build Command:** `npm install` âœ…  
- **Start Command:** `npm start` âœ…
- **JSON Structure:** Fixed âœ…

## Next Steps
1. **Push changes to GitHub** (use Git panel in Replit)
2. **Redeploy in Render** - should work immediately now
3. **Expected success:** Dependencies install properly, server starts with tsx

The JSON error was blocking npm from reading the package.json file. Now it should install dependencies correctly and start your backend.
