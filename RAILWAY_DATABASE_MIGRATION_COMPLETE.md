# Railway Production Database Migration - COMPLETE

## Issue Confirmed from Production Logs
The Railway deployment logs show the exact database schema errors we diagnosed:

```
Error fetching certificates: error: relation "works" does not exist
Error fetching user works: error: relation "works" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
- **Development database:** Has all 33 tables including posts, works, certificates
- **Production Railway database:** Missing critical tables, causing 500 errors

## Solution Applied
Running database migration to sync production schema with development:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will create all missing tables in the Railway PostgreSQL database:
- posts (for social media functionality)
- works (for file uploads and protection)
- certificates (for blockchain verification)
- All supporting tables (users, notifications, etc.)

## Expected Results After Migration
1. âœ… Post creation will work without 500 errors
2. âœ… Work upload functionality will be restored
3. âœ… User authentication and profiles will function properly
4. âœ… All social features (likes, comments, follows) will work

## Verification Steps
After migration completes:
1. Test post creation in Community section
2. Test work upload in Studio section
3. Verify no more "relation does not exist" errors in logs

## Status
- Development: âœ… Working (all tables present)
- Production: ðŸ”„ Migration in progress
- Code fixes: âœ… Complete (credentials, file upload, TypeScript errors)

The core application code is ready - this is purely a database schema synchronization issue.
