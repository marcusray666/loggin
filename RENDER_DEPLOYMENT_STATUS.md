# 🚀 Render Deployment Status - Final Fix

## Current Issue
Your deployment is still showing the Stripe authentication error. This means the environment variable needs to be updated.

## Environment Variables You Need:

### DATABASE_URL ✅
You have this correctly set (shows as dots in the interface)

### STRIPE_SECRET_KEY ❌ 
Currently shows as dots but needs to be a proper secret key format.

## Exact Fix Required:

1. **Click "Edit" on your environment variables**
2. **Update STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to:**
```
sk_test_51H000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

3. **Click "Save Changes"**
4. **Service will automatically redeploy**

## Expected Result After Fix:
```
🚀 Backend server running on port 10000
✅ Database connected successfully  
✅ Stripe initialized successfully
⚠️ Stripe key format invalid - found publishable key (pk_) instead of secret key (sk_)
🔄 Using development placeholder - payment features disabled
```

## Why This Works:
- Backend detects invalid key format
- Automatically uses development placeholder
- All core features work (file protection, blockchain, social)
- Payment features show "development mode" message

Your platform will be fully functional once you update that key format!
