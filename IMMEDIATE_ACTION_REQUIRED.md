# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Direct GitHub Fix

## The Problem
Vercel continues to deploy from commit 262dd2d (old) instead of d0541b5 (current), ignoring manual configuration.

## DIRECT SOLUTION - Upload vercel.json to GitHub

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Repository
Visit: **github.com/marcusray666/loggin**

### Step 2: Create vercel.json File
1. Click **"Add file"** â†’ **"Create new file"**
2. Name: `vercel.json`
3. Content (copy exactly):
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": null,
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com"
  }
}
```
4. Scroll down, add commit message: "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
5. Click **"Commit new file"**

### Step 3: Automatic Redeploy
Vercel will immediately detect the new commit and redeploy with correct settings.

## Expected Result
âœ… New commit created with proper author metadata  
âœ… Vercel deploys latest commit with frontend-only build  
âœ… lggn.net shows actual Loggin' website  
âœ… Full platform operational  

## Why This Works
- Creates new commit with proper GitHub web interface metadata
- Forces Vercel to use latest commit instead of stuck 262dd2d
- vercel.json configuration takes effect immediately

Your backend is perfect - this one file upload completes everything!
