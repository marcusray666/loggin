# ðŸš¨ Immediate Action Required - Git Commit

## The Problem
Vercel is still using the old build configuration because the `vercel.json` file exists locally but hasn't been committed to your GitHub repository.

## What You Need to Do Right Now

### Step 1: Commit the Configuration File
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel config for frontend-only build"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Trigger Vercel Redeploy
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on your project
- Or push any small change to trigger auto-deploy

## Expected Result
After committing and redeploying:
- Vercel will use the new build command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- lggn.net will show your actual React website instead of code
- Frontend will connect to your working backend at loggin-64qr.onrender.com

## Alternative: Manual Vercel Settings
If you can't commit right now, configure manually in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings â†’ Build & Development Settings
2. **Build Command**: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
3. **Output Directory**: `client/dist`
4. **Environment Variables**: Add `VITE_API_URL=https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com`

Your backend is working perfectly - just need this one git commit to complete the full platform deployment!
