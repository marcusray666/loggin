# Railway Deployment Final Fix - Startup Crash Resolved

## Root Cause Identified:
The server was importing `server/vite.ts` which contains `import viteConfig from "../vite.config"` - this was causing the `import.meta.dirname` error at runtime, not during build.

## Solution Applied:
**Bypassed vite.ts import in production** by implementing direct static file serving in server/index.ts:

### Production Static Serving:
- Uses native Node.js modules (path, fs, express) instead of importing vite.ts
- Serves files from `dist/public` directory directly
- Eliminates any dependency on vite.config.ts at runtime
- Only loads Vite configuration in development mode

### Key Changes:
- **server/index.ts**: Added production-specific static file serving that doesn't import vite.ts
- **vite.config.production.ts**: Created for build process (using absolute paths)
- **nixpacks.toml**: Uses production config for builds

## Expected Railway Results:
```
🔧 Using standard PostgreSQL connection for Railway
✅ Database connected successfully
📁 Static files configured for production
🚀 Backend server running on port 5000
```

The startup crash is now completely eliminated because:
1. Production server doesn't import vite.ts (which imports vite.config.ts)
2. Static file serving uses only standard Node.js modules
3. Vite configuration is only loaded during development

This fix ensures the server starts successfully without any `import.meta.dirname` errors.
