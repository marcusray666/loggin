# Railway Final Deployment Fix

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ You have `DATABASE_URL = ${{ loggin-db.DATABASE_URL }}` correctly set
- ‚ùå App still connecting to port 443 instead of 5432

## Possible Causes & Solutions:

### 1. Railway Variable Not Expanding
The `${{ loggin-db.DATABASE_URL }}` might not be resolving correctly.

**Fix:** Copy the actual PostgreSQL URL instead of the reference:
1. Go to `loggin-db` service ‚Üí "Connect" tab
2. Copy the full PostgreSQL connection URL (starts with `postgresql://`)
3. Replace the `${{ loggin-db.DATABASE_URL }}` variable with the actual URL

### 2. Build vs Runtime Issue
Railway might be processing the DATABASE_URL during build time when the reference isn't available.

**Test:** Check your deployment logs after this update - you'll now see:
```
üîó DATABASE_URL format check:
  Protocol: postgresql
  Host:Port: hostname:5432
```

### 3. Database Service Not Ready
The `loggin-db` service might not be fully provisioned.

**Check:**
- Ensure `loggin-db` shows "Active" status in Railway dashboard
- Verify it's not stuck in "Building" or "Failed" state

## Next Steps:
1. Deploy this updated code
2. Check the new debug logs for DATABASE_URL format
3. If protocol/port looks wrong, use the actual PostgreSQL URL instead of the Railway reference

The enhanced logging will show exactly what DATABASE_URL format your app is receiving.
