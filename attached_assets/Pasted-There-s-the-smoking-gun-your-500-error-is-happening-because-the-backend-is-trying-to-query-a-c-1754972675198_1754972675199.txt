There‚Äôs the smoking gun ‚Äî your **500 error** is happening because the backend is trying to query a column that doesn‚Äôt exist in the database:

```
error: column posts.title does not exist
code: 42703
routine: errorMissingColumn
```

### What this means

* Your `posts` table in PostgreSQL **does not have a `title` column**.
* The server code (probably in `DatabaseStorage.getPosts` and also when creating a post) is trying to `SELECT posts.title` or `INSERT INTO posts (title, ‚Ä¶)`.
* Because the column is missing, PostgreSQL throws `42703`, and the whole request fails with a 500.

---

### How to fix it

#### 1. Update your DB schema

If `title` is supposed to be part of the table:

* **Drizzle ORM**: Add `title` to the `posts` table definition and run a migration.

Example:

```ts
// drizzle/schema/posts.ts
export const posts = pgTable("posts", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  userId: integer("user_id").notNull().references(() => users.id),
  title: text("title").notNull(), // üëà add this
  description: text("description"),
  mediaUrl: text("media_url"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});
```

Then generate + push migrations:

```sh
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit push
```

---

#### 2. Or, remove `title` from the code

If your design no longer uses a `title` for posts, you‚Äôll need to:

* Remove `title` from all `SELECT` queries, inserts, and TypeScript interfaces.
* Check `DatabaseStorage.getPosts` and any `INSERT INTO posts` code.

Example:

```ts
// Before
db.select({ id: posts.id, title: posts.title, ... })

// After
db.select({ id: posts.id, description: posts.description, ... })
```

---

### Which path to choose?

* If your **frontend has a ‚Äútitle‚Äù field** (and you want it stored), add the column to the DB (Option 1).
* If you **only use description/media**, remove it from the code and migrations (Option 2).

Given your screenshot, you **do have a title input** when creating posts (‚Äútest13‚Äù), so you probably want **Option 1** ‚Äî add `title` to the table.

---

If you want, I can write you the exact **Drizzle migration** for adding `title` to `posts` so you can run it without losing existing data. That would unblock your post creation instantly.

Do you want me to prep that migration for you?
