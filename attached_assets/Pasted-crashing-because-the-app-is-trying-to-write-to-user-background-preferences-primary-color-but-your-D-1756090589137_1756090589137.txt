crashing because the app is trying to write to user_background_preferences.primary_color, but your DB has primary_colors (array) instead. So Postgres says “column primary_color… does not exist”.
Fastest, safe fix: add the singular columns the code expects, and (optionally) backfill them from the arrays. No breaking renames, no data loss.
1) Add a small migration
Create a new file migrations/0004_background_prefs_compat.sql with this exact SQL:
-- Make code that uses singular columns work on DBs that have arrays.
-- Safe to re-run.

ALTER TABLE user_background_preferences
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS primary_color text,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS secondary_color text;

-- If the array columns exist and have values, backfill the new columns
-- but don't overwrite anything already set.
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name='user_background_preferences' AND column_name='primary_colors'
  ) THEN
    EXECUTE $i$
      UPDATE user_background_preferences
      SET primary_color = COALESCE(primary_color, (primary_colors)[1]),
          secondary_color = COALESCE(secondary_color, (secondary_colors)[1])
    $i$;
  END IF;
END$$;
2) Build & push (your repo already runs migrations on start)
npm run build
git add migrations/0004_background_prefs_compat.sql
git commit -m "fix(db): add primary_color/secondary_color compatibility columns"
git push
Your prestart migrator will run on Railway and apply this automatically.
(You already fixed the earlier dist/migrate.js issue and the missing env vars.)
3) Verify quickly on Railway
Open Deploy logs; you should see “Applied migration: 0004_background_prefs_compat.sql”.
Optional SQL check (Railway’s psql shell or any SQL client):
\d+ user_background_preferences
SELECT id, primary_color, secondary_color, primary_colors, secondary_colors
FROM user_background_preferences
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
Why I’m not renaming
Renaming primary_colors → primary_color would leave the column as text[], but your code is clearly inserting a text value. That type mismatch would break. Adding the singular columns is the least risky, keeps your current code working, and doesn’t destroy existing data.
