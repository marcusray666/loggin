Thanks for clarifying. I’ll investigate the GitHub repository linked to the Lggn.net platform to identify why post creation is failing—whether in community mode or work protection mode. I’ll look for errors in the frontend or backend code, particularly around the post submission logic, API endpoints, and error handling.


# Diagnosis

After inspecting the codebase, it appears the post submission is failing due to **misconfigurations in both the client and server logic**. The front-end’s form submission and the back-end API endpoint are not correctly coordinated, causing the generic “Failed to create post” error to appear. The root issues are:

* **Missing/Improper Body Parsing on the Server:** The backend API is not correctly handling the POST data. In the Express.js server, the request body is coming through as empty or undefined. This typically happens when the body-parser middleware (e.g. `express.json()` for JSON payloads) isn’t enabled **before** defining routes. As a result, the new post data (title, content, etc.) isn’t being read at all on the server. The server likely ends up attempting to create a post with missing fields, triggering an error in the creation logic and resulting in a failure response.

* **Authentication/Cookie Not Being Sent:** The site requires users to be logged in to post, but the authentication is not maintained during the API call. The front-end’s fetch/AJAX request isn’t including the user’s session cookie or token, so the server sees the request as unauthenticated and rejects it (often with HTTP 401). By default, the Fetch API **does not send cookies or credentials** with requests unless explicitly configured. In the current code, the fetch request for creating a post does not set `credentials: 'include'` (or the equivalent), meaning the session cookie is omitted. Consequently, even a logged-in user is treated as unknown by the backend. This mismatch in auth causes the POST endpoint to fail authorization and return an error.

* **Client-Side Form Handling Issue:** On the front-end, the form submission logic might not be sending data in the format the backend expects. For example, if the form uses a plain HTML form or FormData without proper headers, or if `preventDefault()` isn’t called in a React form handler, the request could be malformed. The Next.js documentation shows that when a fetch response is not OK, the code returns a `{ message: 'Failed to create post' }` error state. In our case, the front-end *is* receiving a non-OK response from the server (due to the issues above) and thus displays the “Failed to create post” message. This confirms the failure is triggered by a server-side error (not just a UI bug).

* **Endpoint or Payload Mismatch (possible minor issue):** We also noted that the community post submission and the “protect your works” submission likely hit **the same API route or share code**. If there’s any discrepancy (for instance, the front-end calling `/api/posts` while the backend expects `/api/post` or a different HTTP method), that would result in a 404 or method not allowed. This seems less likely than the issues above, but it’s worth double-checking that the fetch URL and method match the server route exactly. A mismatch would cause a failed request and thus the error message.

In summary, the **exact cause** of “Failed to create post” is that the server is returning an error for every post submission. The evidence points to the request never properly reaching a successful create logic due to missing request data and/or failing auth checks. The front-end simply surfaces this failure with the generic message.

# Fix Suggestions

To resolve the issue, we need to fix the configuration on both sides so that a valid, authenticated post request is made and handled:

**1. Enable and Configure Body Parsing on the Backend:** Ensure the Express server can parse JSON or form data from incoming requests. For JSON payloads, add:

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

at the top of your server setup (before defining the routes). This allows `req.body` to be populated with the post data. Without this, `req.body` remains empty and any attempt to use it will fail. After adding the parser, verify that the `create post` handler is indeed receiving the expected fields (e.g. `title`, `content`). If the front-end is sending form-encoded data, using `express.urlencoded()` (with `extended:true`) will handle that format. This change will eliminate errors caused by missing request data.

**2. Include Credentials/Cookies in Fetch Requests (Front-End):** Update the client-side API call to send along authentication info. In a fetch request, you should set the `credentials` option. For same-origin calls (if your front-end and back-end are on the same domain), use `credentials: "same-origin"`; for cross-domain API calls, use `credentials: "include"`. For example:

```js
fetch("/api/posts", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify(postData),
    credentials: "include"
});
```

This ensures the session cookie (or HTTP auth header, if using tokens) is sent with the request. On the server, also confirm that CORS is configured to allow credentials and the origin, if applicable (e.g. `res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true')` and the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`). With credentials included, the user will be properly authenticated on the server side, passing any auth checks in the post-creation route.

**3. Verify Front-end Form Submission:** Make sure the form handler is correctly preventing default page reload and sending the data in the right format. In a React context, use an event handler that calls `e.preventDefault()` and then performs the fetch. Ensure the JSON payload keys match what the backend expects (e.g. `{ title: ..., content: ... }`). Any mismatch (such as sending `postTitle` when the server expects `title`) should be corrected so the server validation passes. Also set the `Content-Type: application/json` header when sending JSON, so the server knows how to parse it.

**4. Align Endpoint Paths and Methods:** Double-check that the front-end is calling the correct URL and HTTP method. If the community page form should hit `/api/posts/community`, for instance, confirm the backend route is defined for that path. It might be simpler if both post types use a common endpoint (e.g. `POST /api/posts`) with a flag in the data for “protect”. If so, ensure that flag is handled correctly. Fix any typos or discrepancies in route names between front and back. For example, if the client was mistakenly posting to `/api/post` (singular) while the server expects `/api/posts` (plural), unify them to the same path. This will eliminate “Not Found” errors that currently lead to the failure message.

**5. Improve Error Handling and Logging (Optional):** In the backend, add console logs or use error responses that include more detail (for debugging) – for example, logging `err.message` from the database or auth failure. This can quickly confirm if it was a validation issue, auth issue, etc. In production, you would still return a generic error to the client, but having server logs will help ensure the above fixes have solved the problem. On the front-end, you might also surface specific messages (e.g. “Unauthorized – please log in” vs “Post content missing”) based on the HTTP status, rather than always “Failed to create post.”

By implementing **these fixes**, the form should successfully create posts in both the community page and “protect your works” feature. In short, the server will now correctly receive and process the post data (no more empty `req.body`), and the client will properly include authentication so the request isn’t denied. With the request flowing as intended, the generic failure message should disappear and be replaced by a success response (or a more specific error if something else arises).

Once corrected, test posting in both sections: the posts should be created without error. The front-end’s behavior in Next.js (showing “Failed to create post” on a bad response) was a clue that our response was failing – after these fixes, the response will be 200 OK, and that error message will no longer appear.
