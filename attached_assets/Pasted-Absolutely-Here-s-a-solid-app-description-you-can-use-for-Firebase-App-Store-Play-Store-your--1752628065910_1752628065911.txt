### **Prooff – Protect. Create. Own Your Art.**

**Prooff** is a modern app that empowers creators to easily protect, register, and prove ownership of their digital artwork and creative projects. Built for artists, designers, musicians, and innovators, Prooff lets you create instant, verifiable proof of your original work—right from your phone.

#### **How It Works:**

* **Register Your Work Instantly:**
  Upload your art, photo, music, or design and create a digital certificate of ownership within seconds.
* **Blockchain & NFT Verification:**
  Every registered work is timestamped and anchored to the blockchain (via NFT or hash), giving you a permanent, unchangeable record.
* **Share or Prove Ownership:**
  Instantly share your certificate as a PDF, QR code, or secure link for legal protection, collaboration, or sales.
* **Report Theft/Enforce Your Rights:**
  If someone steals your work, use Prooff to generate and send takedown notices to platforms like Instagram, YouTube, or TikTok—complete with proof of registration.
* **Go Further:**
  Get step-by-step guidance to submit your work to government copyright offices or connect with online notary services for added legal protection.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Instant Certificate Generation** (PDF, NFT, or hash—your choice)
* **Secure Dashboard:** All your works and certificates in one place, always accessible.
* **One-Click Reporting:** Send takedown requests to social media, marketplaces, or legal entities.
* **Blockchain Integration:** Each certificate includes a unique ID, timestamp, and on-chain proof.
* **Share Everywhere:** By email, text, WhatsApp, or social media.
* **Multi-Platform:** Works on Android, iOS, and (coming soon) web.

#### **Who Is It For?**

* Artists, designers, musicians, photographers, writers, entrepreneurs, and anyone who creates original digital content.

### **NSF / NFT Details (for Investors & Store Reviewers):**

* **NFT Option:** Users can opt to mint their certificate as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) for extra proof of authenticity and public record.
* **Blockchain:** All registrations are anchored on a secure, tamper-proof blockchain, creating a timestamped, decentralized record.
* **Privacy First:** Only work metadata and proofs are stored on-chain; your actual content stays private unless you choose to share it.
