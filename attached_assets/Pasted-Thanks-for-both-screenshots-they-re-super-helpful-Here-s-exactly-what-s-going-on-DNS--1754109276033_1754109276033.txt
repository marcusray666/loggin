Thanks for both screenshots — they’re super helpful. Here's exactly what's going on:

---

## ✅ DNS & Domain Setup: ✅ All Good

From your Cloudflare + Railway setup:

* ✅ Your domain `lggn.net` is correctly **CNAME’d** to `8onb9un6.up.railway.app`
* ✅ Proxying via Cloudflare is active (that’s fine)
* ✅ Railway recognizes the domain and is linking it to the correct service

So the problem **isn’t DNS** — the domain is pointed correctly.

---

## ❌ The Real Problem: Nothing is Running or Listening at `/`

That “train has not arrived” error from Railway means:

> Your Railway project is live, **but there’s no app serving HTTP requests on port `5000` or `PORT`** (which is what Railway exposes).

---

## 🚨 What’s Likely Missing:

### 1. **Your backend isn’t listening to `process.env.PORT`**

This is *the most common mistake*. Your server might be using a hardcoded port like `3000`, `8080`, or `5173`.

### ✅ Fix:

In your backend `index.ts` or `server.ts` file, update this line:

```ts
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  // ✅ Must support Railway's dynamic port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### 2. **Your start command isn’t running the backend correctly**

Check the **Start Command** in Railway → **Deploy → Settings → Start Command**.

If your backend is in `packages/server/`, it should be something like:

```bash
cd packages/server && npm run start
```

Also confirm that your `packages/server/package.json` includes a working start script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

If you’re using TypeScript directly, use:

```json
"start": "ts-node src/index.ts"
```

---

### 3. **You never built the frontend or served it**

If you’re trying to serve both the frontend and backend from the same service:

* You must build the frontend:

  ```bash
  cd packages/web && npm run build
  ```
* Then serve the built files from backend (e.g., `Express`):

```ts
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "../web/dist")));

app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../web/dist/index.html"));
});
```

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix (Summary)

1. **Fix the backend port**:

   * Replace any `app.listen(3000)` or `app.listen(5173)` with:

     ```ts
     const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Running on ${PORT}`));
     ```

2. **Make sure you’re starting the right service**

   * In Railway, go to Deploy → Settings
   * Set start command to:

     ```bash
     cd packages/server && npm run start
     ```

3. **(Optional) Build frontend and serve it**

   * If you're using one project to serve everything

---

Once done, **redeploy on Railway**. Your website `lggn.net` should go live in under a minute.
