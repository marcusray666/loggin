Understood. Let’s fix this now — no guessing, just clear steps based on everything you've shared.

## 🔥 You're Facing 2 Ongoing Issues:

### 1. ❌ `https://lggn.net` still shows "Train has not arrived"

### 2. ❌ Admin login `vladislavdonighevici111307` / `admin` still returns 401

I’ll walk you through **how to fix both**, based on what your current code and logs show.

---

## ✅ 1. FIX THE "TRAIN NOT ARRIVED" ERROR

### 🔍 Root Cause

Your backend **isn't running or listening properly**, which means Railway has nothing to serve — that’s why you still see that screen.

### ✅ 3-Point Checklist:

#### ✅ A. `DATABASE_URL` is missing — **you must add it**

Go to:

* **Railway → Your Project → Variables**
* Add this:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
```

**If you're using Railway’s PostgreSQL plugin:**

* Click the plugin (the DB service)
* Copy the `DATABASE_URL`
* Paste it into your web service's Variables tab

#### ✅ B. You must **redeploy the project**

Once the variable is set:

* Go to your main app service
* Click **“Deployments” → “Redeploy”**
* It must boot up without crashing

#### ✅ C. Make sure Express server is using the correct port

In `server/index.ts` you already have:

```ts
const PORT = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '5000');
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`✅ Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

✅ That’s good — no changes needed there as long as it deploys successfully.

## ✅ 2. FIX ADMIN LOGIN `401 Unauthorized`

### 🔍 Root Cause

The admin user **was never inserted into the production DB**, even though your code has seeding logic.

### ✅ Fix It Like This:

#### 🔧 A. Open your `server/index.ts`

Make sure this logic exists (after DB init):

```ts
const adminUsername = 'vladislavdonighevici111307';
const adminPass = 'admin';

const result = await pool.query(
  'SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username = $1',
  [adminUsername]
);

if (result.rowCount === 0) {
  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(adminPass, 12);
  await pool.query(
    `INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email, role, is_verified)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)`,
    [adminUsername, hash, 'admin@example.com', 'admin', true]
  );
  console.log('✅ Admin user created');
}
```

> ✅ From what you’ve shared, this code *is* in your repo — so no changes needed *if it's running*.

#### 🔧 B. But… it only runs if the server starts successfully

That’s why you need to fix issue #1 first — your server isn’t even running long enough to insert the admin user.

## ✅ Summary: Here's What to Do Now

| Step | Task                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Go to Railway → Variables tab                                           |
| 2    | Add your `DATABASE_URL` exactly                                         |
| 3    | Redeploy your service                                                   |
| 4    | Wait for server logs to show “✅ Admin user created”                     |
| 5    | Visit `https://lggn.net` and try logging in with your admin credentials |

💬 **If that doesn’t work**, send me:

* A screenshot of your Railway **Variables tab**
* The **deploy logs after the fix**
* Confirmation of whether you see `✅ Admin user created` in logs

And I’ll walk you through the exact fix live. You're just one config away from being live.
