Thanks for sharing all the screenshots — here’s what I found:

---

## ✅ Your Setup Looks **Correct**:

* Your **`DATABASE_URL` is present** in both `loggin-fullstack` and `loggin-db`.
* It's pointing to the correct internal Railway address:

  ```
  postgresql://postgres:<password>@loggin-db.railway.internal:5432/railway
  ```
* `NODE_ENV` is set to `"production"`, which is necessary for the build script to trigger `drizzle-kit push`.

---

## ❗ But Here’s Likely Why Tables Are STILL Missing

Even though everything **looks good**, there’s **one key issue:**

> Your Drizzle migration step **only runs if `DATABASE_URL` is available *at build time*** — but **Railway’s build phase does not use environment variables from the “Variables” tab** unless explicitly handled.

---

## 🔥 Real Problem: Railway Build Environment ≠ Runtime Environment

When Railway builds your app (during deploy), it **doesn't automatically inject those env vars into the `build` phase**. That means:

* Your script like this:

  ```bash
  if [ -n "$DATABASE_URL" ]; then
     npx drizzle-kit push
  fi
  ```

  silently **skips** `drizzle-kit push` because `DATABASE_URL` is empty at build time.

---

## ✅ How to Fix It (2 Options)

### **🛠 Option 1: Manually Run Migration Once**

Just run this from your local terminal to push your schema to Railway:

```bash
# (1) Make sure you have the correct DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:<password>@<your-db-host>:5432/railway"

# (2) Run this from project root
npx drizzle-kit push
```

Or:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

✅ This will create all 34+ tables from `shared/schema.ts`.

> You can get the public `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` from the “loggin-db” service → Variables tab (already shown in your 2nd screenshot).

---

### **🛠 Option 2: Force Migrations in Runtime**

If you want to be 100% sure that your production always has tables, even if Railway skips build vars, add this **startup check**:

#### ✅ Add this to your `src/server.ts` or `index.ts`:

```ts
import { db } from "./db"; // or wherever your drizzle client is
import { users } from "../shared/schema";

async function ensureSchema() {
  try {
    await db.select().from(users).limit(1);
    console.log("✅ Database schema exists.");
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn("⚠️ Missing schema, pushing now...");
    const { execSync } = require("child_process");
    execSync("npx drizzle-kit push", { stdio: "inherit" });
  }
}

ensureSchema();
```

💡 That way, **if your tables are missing at runtime**, it will **push your full schema** on app start.

---

## ✅ Recommended Final Steps

1. **Run migration manually once** (see Option 1).
2. Optional but safe: **add `ensureSchema()` runtime check** (Option 2).
3. Check Railway logs → make sure there are no more errors like:

   ```
   relation "works" does not exist
   ```
4. Try posting again at `lggn.net` — if your tables are there, it should work!

If you want, I can verify your `drizzle.config.ts` and `package.json` scripts to make sure they’re wired up properly too. Just upload those files or paste them.
