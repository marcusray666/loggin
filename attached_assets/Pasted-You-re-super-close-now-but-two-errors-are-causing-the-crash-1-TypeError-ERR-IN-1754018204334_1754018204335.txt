You're super close now — but **two errors** are causing the crash:

---

### ❌ 1. `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined`

This comes from this part:

```
at vite.config.ts (file:///app/dist/index.js:32:22)
```

This likely means you're using something like:

```ts
path.resolve(__dirname, someVariable)
```

...but `someVariable` is `undefined`.

#### ✅ Fix:

* In your **Vite config**, you're probably referencing an env variable or file path that isn't set.
* Double-check all `resolve()` paths — make sure nothing is `undefined`.
* Also verify you're not referencing `process.env.SOME_VAR` that hasn’t been added in Railway yet.

> 🔍 Tip: If you're using `path.resolve(...)` in `vite.config.ts`, inspect every argument passed in and ensure they’re all strings.

---

### ❌ 2. `Database connection failed: ECONNREFUSED fd12:6eea:...`

Your app is trying to connect to the **IPv6 address** of the database on port 443 — but PostgreSQL doesn't run on port 443, and that’s likely the issue.

#### ✅ Fix:

Check the `DATABASE_URL` variable in Railway → `Variables`:

It **must** look like this:

```
postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname
```

* No `https://`
* Make sure port is `5432`
* Don’t use IPv6 unless PostgreSQL requires it (it usually doesn’t)

You can get the correct value by clicking your PostgreSQL plugin → **Connect** tab → copy the full connection URL and paste it into your `DATABASE_URL`.

---

### 🛠 TL;DR Fix Steps

1. In Railway → **PostgreSQL plugin** → copy the proper PostgreSQL connection URL
2. Go to Railway → `loggin-fullstack` → **Variables tab**

   * Update `DATABASE_URL` with correct value
3. Check your `vite.config.ts` — find where `resolve()` or `path.*` is used

   * Add `console.log()` or default values to prevent undefined arguments

If you send me your `vite.config.ts` file (or the snippet with `path.resolve`), I can tell you exactly what’s wrong.

Let me know — you're 2 steps away from a clean launch.
