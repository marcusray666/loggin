Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed full app design** for your project (using a premium name like **Vaultyn** or **Proteqta**). This will include the overall structure, main screens, community/social features, and every key button, menu, and option. I’ll assume you want a modern, secure, and creative vibe—think a little like Dropbox + Behance + legal protection, but fresh.
