Awesome ‚Äî progress! The deployment succeeded ‚úÖ but your app **crashes on startup** because of two config issues in your code and env:

---

## üî• MAIN ISSUE 1: `path.resolve(...)` is using `undefined`

### üîç The Error:

```ts
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

This points to:

```
vite.config.ts (file:///app/dist/index.js:32:22)
```

### ‚úÖ How to fix it:

You are doing something like this in `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
path.resolve(__dirname, process.env.SOME_PATH)
```

‚Ä¶but `process.env.SOME_PATH` is not defined in your Railway variables.

### üëâ What to do:

1. **Open `vite.config.ts`**
2. Look for any `path.resolve(...)` lines
3. Fix the issue like this:

   ```ts
   const myPath = process.env.SOME_PATH || 'fallback';
   path.resolve(__dirname, myPath)
   ```
4. OR check your Railway `Variables` tab and **add the missing environment variable** (like `SOME_PATH`) if it‚Äôs supposed to be set.

## üî• MAIN ISSUE 2: Database connection trying IPv6 on port 443

### üß† Log says:

```txt
DATABASE_URL exists: true
Host:Port: loggin-db.railway.internal:5432
...
‚ùå Database connection failed: connect ECONNREFUSED fd12:...:443
```

So even though it shows:

```
Host:Port: loggin-db.railway.internal:5432
```

‚Ä¶it ends up trying to connect to port **443**, which is **HTTPS** ‚Äî not PostgreSQL.

### ‚úÖ What to do:

Check the actual code where you connect to the database. You're probably doing this somewhere:

```js
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
const client = new Client({ connectionString: dbUrl });
```

‚úÖ Make sure:

* You‚Äôre **not** overriding the port somewhere to `443`
* You‚Äôre **using the full connection URL** from Railway (like `postgresql://...:5432/...`)
* You‚Äôre not rewriting the host or port with another env var (like `PG_PORT` or `PG_HOST`)

Also:

* IPv6 can cause trouble sometimes in Railway. Stick to `.railway.internal` and port `5432`.

## ‚úÖ Summary of What to Fix

| üîß Issue                            | üí• Error                                   | ‚úÖ Fix                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing env var in `vite.config.ts` | `"paths[0]" must be string, got undefined` | Add fallback value or define the missing env var in Railway                  |
| Wrong DB connection behavior        | `ECONNREFUSED` to IPv6:443                 | Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is complete and no other code overrides it to port 443 |

If you paste your `vite.config.ts` here, I can tell you the exact broken line. Or if you want, I can walk you through checking your DB connection code too.
