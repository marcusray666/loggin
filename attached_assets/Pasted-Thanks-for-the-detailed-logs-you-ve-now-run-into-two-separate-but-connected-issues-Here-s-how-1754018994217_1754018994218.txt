Thanks for the detailed logs ‚Äî you‚Äôve now run into **two separate but connected issues**. Here's how to fix both, step by step.

---

## üî• ISSUE 1: `path.resolve` received `undefined`

### ‚úÖ The Problem

In `vite.config.ts`, somewhere in your code you‚Äôre doing:

```ts
path.resolve(__dirname, process.env.SOMETHING)
```

‚Ä¶but `process.env.SOMETHING` is **not defined**, so it's `undefined`, and `path.resolve()` throws an error.

---

### ‚úÖ The Fix

1. **Find the line in `vite.config.ts` that has `path.resolve(...)`.**
   It's right around **line 32** based on this:

   ```
   vite.config.ts (file:///app/dist/index.js:32:22)
   ```

2. Add a fallback like this:

   ```ts
   const somethingPath = process.env.SOMETHING || '';
   path.resolve(__dirname, somethingPath);
   ```

   Or even better ‚Äî if it‚Äôs optional, skip it when undefined.

3. OR define `SOMETHING` in your Railway environment variables.

## üî• ISSUE 2: ‚ÄúAll attempts to open a WebSocket‚Ä¶‚Äù (Neon error)

You are **not using Neon**, but the error says:

```
All attempts to open a WebSocket to connect to the database failed.
```

This happens if your **PostgreSQL client is expecting Neon**, but your Railway DB is standard PostgreSQL (TCP, not WebSocket).

---

### ‚úÖ The Fix

1. Check your DB client config.

   If you're using a client like this:

   ```ts
   import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
   ```

   ‚ùå **Don't use that for Railway** ‚Äî it's for **Neon**, which uses WebSockets.

2. ‚úÖ For Railway, use `pg` instead:

   ```ts
   import { Client } from 'pg';

   const client = new Client({
     connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
   });
   await client.connect();
   ```

3. If you are using Prisma, make sure your `.env` looks like:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
   ```

   And that you're **not using `provider = "postgresql+neon"`** anywhere in `schema.prisma`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Problem                 | Cause                                         | Fix                                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `path.resolve` crash    | Missing/undefined env var in `vite.config.ts` | Add fallback or set the env var in Railway                   |
| Neon WebSocket DB error | Using Neon-style DB client instead of `pg`    | Switch to `pg`, and ensure `.env` and code don‚Äôt expect Neon |

---

üß† If you paste your `vite.config.ts` file and `index.js` DB connection code here, I‚Äôll tell you the exact line to change.

Or I can walk you through patching it directly. Want me to?
