# ðŸ”„ Git Sync Instructions - Your Changes Are Ready!

## What You're Seeing
The Git panel shows:
- **8 commits to push** - These include the Vercel fixes I just made
- **3 commits to pull** - Remote changes from GitHub
- **Merge conflicts warning** - Local and remote branches have diverged

## How to Sync and Deploy the Fix

### Step 1: Pull and Merge
1. Click **"Pull"** button in the Git panel
2. This will pull the remote changes and start a merge
3. If there are conflicts, Replit will show them for you to resolve

### Step 2: Push Your Changes
1. After pulling, click **"Push"** button
2. This will upload all the Vercel fix files:
   - Updated vercel.json
   - New .vercelignore
   - New vercel-build.js script

### Step 3: Automatic Deployment
Once pushed, Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the new commit
- Use the corrected build configuration
- Deploy frontend-only (no more server code!)
- Make lggn.net show your actual website

## The Fix is Ready
All the code changes to fix Vercel are complete:
- vercel.json forces frontend-only build
- .vercelignore excludes server files
- vercel-build.js ensures proper compilation

Just sync with Git and your deployment will be fixed!
