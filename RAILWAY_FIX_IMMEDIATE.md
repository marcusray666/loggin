# Railway Deployment Fix - IMMEDIATE

## Issue Identified
Railway deployment failed with error: **"The executable `node_env=production` could not be found"**

## Root Cause
Start command syntax error in `railway.json` - Railway couldn't parse the environment variable prefix.

## Fix Applied
```json
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
"startCommand": "NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts"

// AFTER (FIXED)
"startCommand": "tsx server/index.ts"
```

## Why This Works
- Railway automatically sets `NODE_ENV=production` in production environment
- No need to manually specify environment variables in start command
- Server detects production mode through `process.env.NODE_ENV`

## Additional Optimizations
- Simplified build process to focus on frontend build only
- Backend runs directly with `tsx` (TypeScript execution)
- Environment detection logging added for debugging

## Expected Result
Next Railway deployment will:
1. Build frontend successfully
2. Start server with correct command syntax
3. Automatically detect production environment
4. Create database schema on startup
5. Serve application at lggn.net

**Status:** Critical deployment blocker resolved - ready for redeployment.
