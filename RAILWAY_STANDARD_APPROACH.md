# Railway Deployment - Standard Node.js Approach

## Issue Analysis
Railway failed to find `tsx` executable, indicating the TypeScript runtime approach isn't working in their environment.

## Solution: Use Standard Node.js Build Pipeline

### Changes Applied:
1. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (uses existing esbuild pipeline)
2. **Start Command**: `npm start` (runs compiled JavaScript)
3. **Build Process**: 
   - Frontend: Vite builds to `dist/public`
   - Backend: ESBuild compiles TypeScript to `dist/index.js`

### Why This Works:
- Uses Railway's standard Node.js detection
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript at build time
- No runtime TypeScript dependencies needed
- Follows Node.js production best practices

### Build Pipeline Flow:
```bash
npm run build -> 
  vite build (frontend to dist/public) + 
  esbuild server/index.ts (backend to dist/index.js)

npm start -> 
  NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

### Expected Result:
- Railway will detect standard Node.js project
- Build process will compile both frontend and backend
- Production server will serve from compiled JavaScript
- Application will be live at lggn.net

**Status**: Using Railway's recommended Node.js deployment pattern for maximum compatibility.
