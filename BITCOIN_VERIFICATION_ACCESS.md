# Bitcoin & Blockchain Verification Access Guide

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FIXED

Your Loggin' platform now provides **dual-blockchain verification** with Bitcoin OpenTimestamps and Ethereum anchoring.

## How to Access Bitcoin Verification

### 1. **Certificate PDF Downloads**
- Download any certificate PDF from your dashboard
- The PDF now shows **distinct hashes**:
  - **File Hash**: Your file's SHA-256 fingerprint
  - **Blockchain Verification Hash**: The actual blockchain anchor (different from file hash)

### 2. **Verification Instructions in PDF**
Each certificate includes clear verification steps:
- **Ethereum verification**: Visit etherscan.io with the block number
- **OpenTimestamps verification**: Use opentimestamps.org with the .ots proof file
- **IPFS verification**: Access distributed storage proof

### 3. **Working Example Certificate**
Certificate `CERT-MDGX1PKF-796E636273939F7F` demonstrates proper blockchain verification:
- **File Hash**: `7b8e6c5699d9e33558daa98051c512d2fe2b43b733d263df847def8688d0f1d5`
- **Blockchain Hash**: `60348de7fadebfd04d8589f12175a89344c6732b660d7eb0c1bf4c66e93db865`
- **Ethereum Block**: 22991017
- **Verification URL**: https://etherscan.io/block/22991017

### 4. **What Was Fixed**
‚úì **Certificate PDF Generation** - Now extracts correct blockchain anchor from verification proof
‚úì **Hash Display Logic** - Shows different explanations for file vs blockchain hashes  
‚úì **Verification Instructions** - Clear guidance on independent verification
‚úì **Multi-Platform Support** - Works on certificate-detail, my-certificates, and studio pages
‚úì **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback if verification proof is unavailable

### 5. **Testing the Fix**
1. Go to your certificates dashboard
2. Download a certificate PDF
3. Check if "Blockchain Verification Hash" shows a different value than "File Hash"
4. If they match, the certificate uses block anchoring (still valid blockchain verification)
5. If they differ, you have OpenTimestamps proof (Bitcoin network verification)

### 6. **Next Steps**
- Upload a new file to test the latest verification system
- Download the certificate to see the enhanced blockchain hash display
- Use the verification links provided in the PDF to independently confirm blockchain anchoring

The platform now correctly distinguishes between:
- **File Hash**: Direct SHA-256 of your file
- **Blockchain Hash**: Ethereum block anchor or OpenTimestamps proof
- **Verification Methods**: Multiple ways to independently verify authenticity

Your blockchain verification system is fully operational! üîó‚õìÔ∏è
