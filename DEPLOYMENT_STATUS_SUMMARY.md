# üöÄ Deployment Status Summary - Both Issues Identified & Fixed

## Issue #1: Local Development CORS Errors ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to connect to remote backend instead of local
**Solution**: Updated queryClient.ts to default to localhost:5000 for development
**Status**: Fixed - local development now connects to local backend

## Issue #2: Vercel Deployment Showing Code ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS GIT COMMIT
**Problem**: lggn.net shows server code because vercel.json isn't committed to GitHub
**Solution**: vercel.json file created but needs to be committed and pushed
**Status**: Ready for commit - will fix frontend deployment

## Current Working Setup:
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com (fully operational)
- ‚úÖ **Database**: PostgreSQL on Render (connected and working)
- ‚úÖ **Local Development**: Now connects to localhost:5000 (fixed CORS)
- üîÑ **Production Frontend**: Needs git commit to deploy properly

## Next Action Required:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel config for frontend-only build"  
git push origin main
```

Then redeploy on Vercel - lggn.net will show proper website instead of code.

Your Loggin' platform will be fully deployed once this commit is made!
