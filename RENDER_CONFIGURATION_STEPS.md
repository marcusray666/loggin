# URGENT: Fix Your Render Configuration

## The Problem
Your Render is still using the old configuration. The error shows:
- It's looking for `/opt/render/project/src/dist/index.js` (wrong path)
- It's not finding the compiled TypeScript files
- You need to update Render to use the new backend structure

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Update Render Service Settings

Go to your Render dashboard for the `loggin-64qr` service and update:

**ROOT DIRECTORY:** `backend` (CRITICAL - this tells Render to look in the backend folder)

**BUILD COMMAND:** `npm run build`

**START COMMAND:** `npm start`

### 2. Environment Variables (if not already set)
Make sure these are set in Render:
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
```

### 3. Deploy Again
After updating the configuration, trigger a new deployment.

## Why This Will Work
- The `backend/` directory has proper TypeScript compilation
- `npm run build` compiles TypeScript to `backend/dist/index.js`
- `npm start` runs the compiled `backend/dist/index.js`
- The file paths will now be correct

## Expected Success Output
After the fix, you should see:
```
==> Running build command 'npm run build'...
âœ“ TypeScript compilation successful
==> Running 'npm start'
ðŸš€ Backend server running on port 10000
```

The key issue is the ROOT DIRECTORY setting - Render needs to know to look in the `backend` folder, not the project root!
