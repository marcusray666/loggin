## Configuration Verification ✅

### 1. Railway Build Command ✅

  "buildCommand": "vite build --outDir dist/public && npm run db:push"
}
```

- **Database Schema**: Pushed during build process
- **Project Structure**: Unified fullstack (no separate client/ directory needed)

### 2. Admin User Status ✅
- **Username**: `vladislavdonighevici111307`
