# ðŸ”§ Manual Vercel Fix - Direct Configuration

## The Problem
Vercel is still cloning **Commit: 262dd2d** which doesn't include the vercel.json file. That's why it's still using the wrong build command.

## Direct Solution: Configure Vercel Manually

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit **vercel.com** and log into your account
2. Find your **loggin** project
3. Click on **Settings**

### Step 2: Update Build Settings
Go to **Build & Development Settings** and change:

**Current Settings (Wrong):**
- Build Command: `npm run build` 
- Output Directory: (auto-detected)

**New Settings (Correct):**
- Build Command: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- Output Directory: `client/dist`
- Install Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variable
Go to **Environment Variables** and add:
- Key: `VITE_API_URL`
- Value: `https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com`
- Environment: Production

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Select **Use existing Build Cache: No**

## Expected Result
After these changes, your next deployment will:
- Build only the frontend (React app)
- Connect to your working backend
- Show the actual Loggin' website at lggn.net

## Alternative: GitHub Web Upload
If you prefer, you can also:
1. Go to **github.com/marcusray666/loggin**
2. Click **Add file â†’ Create new file**
3. Name it `vercel.json`
4. Paste the configuration and commit

Both methods will fix the deployment issue!
