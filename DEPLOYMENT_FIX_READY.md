# ✅ Deployment Fix Files Ready to Commit

## Files Created and Ready for Git
I've created the following files that git can now see as untracked:

1. **vercel-frontend-config.json** - Contains the correct Vercel configuration
2. **frontend-vercel.json** - Backup configuration file

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Use Replit's Git Panel (Easiest)
1. Look for the **Git/Version Control panel** in Replit's left sidebar
2. You should see the new files listed as untracked
3. Stage and commit them with message: "Fix Vercel frontend deployment"

### Option 2: Manual GitHub Upload
1. Go to **github.com/marcusray666/loggin**
2. Click **"Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
3. Name it: `vercel.json`
4. Copy the content from `vercel-frontend-config.json` file
5. Commit the changes

## The Fix
The new vercel.json configuration forces Vercel to:
- Build only the frontend (client directory)
- Use correct output directory (client/dist)
- Connect to your working backend
- Stop building server code

## Expected Result
Once committed and deployed:
- lggn.net shows your actual Loggin' website
- Users can register, login, upload files
- Full platform operational

Your backend is working perfectly - this completes the deployment!
