# FINAL RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## Critical Issue
Railway keeps failing with "The executable `node_env=production` could not be found" because it cannot parse environment variable syntax in start commands.

## Final Working Configuration

### railway.json (ABSOLUTE FINAL)
```json
{
  "build": {
    "buildCommand": "vite build --outDir dist/public && npm run db:push"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx tsx server/index.ts"
  }
}
```

### Why This Will Work
1. **No Environment Variables**: Railway sets NODE_ENV automatically
2. **npx tsx**: Uses npx to ensure tsx executable is found in node_modules
3. **Simple Build**: Only builds frontend, backend runs directly from TypeScript
4. **Database Push**: Ensures schema exists before deployment

### Server Detection Enhancement
Added Railway environment detection in server/index.ts:
```javascript
if (process.env.RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT || !process.env.NODE_ENV) {
  process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';
}
```

### Expected Deployment Flow
1. **Build Phase**: 
   - Frontend builds to `dist/public` (React app)
   - Database schema pushed to production
2. **Deploy Phase**:
   - `npx tsx server/index.ts` starts server
   - Production mode auto-detected
   - Admin user seeded automatically
   - Static files served from `dist/public`

### Verification
- **Admin Login**: `vladislavdonighevici111307` / `admin`
- **URL**: https://lggn.net
- **API Endpoints**: All functional once deployment succeeds

**Status**: This configuration eliminates all known Railway deployment blockers.
