# Railway PostgreSQL Connection Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Fixed Neon WebSocket Error
**Problem**: App was using `@neondatabase/serverless` client trying to connect via WebSocket to Railway's standard PostgreSQL
**Solution**: 
- Switched from `@neondatabase/serverless` to standard `pg` package
- Updated Drizzle configuration to use `drizzle-orm/node-postgres`
- Removed WebSocket configuration that was incompatible with Railway

### 2. Fixed Vite Config Path Resolution
**Problem**: `import.meta.dirname` undefined in production causing `path.resolve` to fail
**Solution**:
- Created production-safe Vite config with fallback directory resolution
- Uses `process.cwd()` with error handling and `fileURLToPath` fallback
- Updated build script to use production config for Railway builds

### 3. Database Configuration Updated
**Changes Made**:
- Now uses standard PostgreSQL connection pool
- Proper SSL configuration for production
- Simplified connection parameters optimized for Railway

## Expected Railway Deployment Results:
```
ðŸ”§ Using standard PostgreSQL connection for Railway
ðŸ”— DATABASE_URL format check:
  Protocol: postgresql
  Host:Port: loggin-db.railway.internal:5432
âœ… Database connected successfully
ðŸš€ Backend server running on port 5000
```

## Files Updated:
- `server/db.ts` - Switched to standard PostgreSQL client
- `server/vite-prod-config.ts` - Production-safe path resolution
- `build.sh` - Uses production Vite config
- `package.json` - Added `pg` and `@types/pg` dependencies

The app should now build and deploy successfully on Railway without WebSocket or path resolution errors.
