# ðŸ”§ Frontend Deployment Fix - Loggin' Platform

## Issue Identified
Your deployment at lggn.net is showing code instead of the website because:
1. **Mixed project structure** - You have both frontend and backend in one repository
2. **Wrong build command** - The deployment is trying to build the full-stack app, not just frontend
3. **Configuration mismatch** - Need separate frontend build configuration

## Solution: Frontend-Only Build

### Option 1: Fix Current Deployment (Quick Fix)
Update your deployment settings:

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm run build:frontend
```

**Build Directory:** 
```
dist/public
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com
```

### Option 2: Separate Frontend Repository (Recommended)
1. **Extract client folder** to separate repository
2. **Use client/package.json** for dependencies
3. **Deploy from frontend-only repo**

## Frontend Build Scripts Needed

I'll create the proper build script for you in the main package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:frontend": "vite build",
    "build:frontend-only": "cd client && npm install && npm run build"
  }
}
```

## Expected Result
Once fixed, lggn.net should show:
- âœ… Loggin' homepage with login/register
- âœ… Responsive design and navigation  
- âœ… Connection to backend API at loggin-64qr.onrender.com
- âœ… Full platform functionality

Your backend is working perfectly - just need to fix the frontend build process!
