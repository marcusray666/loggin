# ðŸ”§ Local Development Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The frontend was trying to connect to the remote Render backend instead of the local backend, causing CORS errors.

## Solution Applied
Temporarily hardcoded the API URL to `http://localhost:5000` in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` to force local development to work.

## For Production Deployment (Vercel)
The vercel.json file configures the environment variable properly:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "VITE_API_URL": "https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com"
  }
}
```

## Current Status
- âœ… **Local Development**: Now forced to use localhost:5000
- âœ… **Backend**: Operational on Render at https://loggin-64qr.onrender.com
- âœ… **Database**: Connected and working
- ðŸ”„ **Production Frontend**: Needs vercel.json committed to GitHub

## Next Steps for Complete Deployment
1. **Commit vercel.json** to GitHub repository
2. **Redeploy on Vercel** - will automatically use production backend URL
3. **Test both environments** - local and production

The local development should now work without CORS errors!
